Add a WhatsApp button to engage customers, even for out-of-stock products, boosting sales and maximizing opportunities!

== Description ==

The **WAPS Service** plugin facilitates seamless integration of a WhatsApp button onto your website, specifically designed to re-engage customers when products are out of stock. By leveraging direct communication through WhatsApp, this plugin aims to mitigate lost sales opportunities due to product unavailability.
